# stream-tiff-metadata

## Reads a minimal number of bytes to extract TIFF metadata rather than having to read the entire file like most utilities. This is substantially faster, especially over network shares.

### Retreives the following metadata

- ImageWidth
- ImageLength
- XResolution
- YResolution

See the [TIFF Tags Reference](https://www.awaresystems.be/imaging/tiff/tifftags/baseline.html) for other metadata that could be extracted.

### Implementations

- Node.js
- VBA

### Disclaimer

This code was generated by ChatGPT. It worked well for me; I was able to get metadata for a few hundred thousand images over a network share in minutes. I think it should work for most TIFFs, but I only tested it on the ones I had access to. See the LICENSE file for additional disclaimers.
